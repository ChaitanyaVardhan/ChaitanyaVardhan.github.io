Given a set of rectangular 3D disks, stack the disks on top of one another to achieve the max height
subject to the constraint that the disk that goes above another disk has a strictly smaller length and
a strictly smaller breadth. In other words, L<sub>above</sub> \< L<sub>below</sub> and B<sub>above</sub> \<
B<sub>below</sub>. You also can't rotate any box. In other words, all boxes should have their length edge
in the same direction.
